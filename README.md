üìà Performance & Load Testing
We simulate thousands of users booking flights simultaneously using Apache JMeter to measure:

API Endpoint	Avg Response Time	Error Rate	Throughput
/searchFlights	250 ms	0%	150 requests/s
/bookFlight	300 ms	1.5%	120 requests/s
/convertCurrency	150 ms	0%	180 requests/s
